## Creating and Publishing a Snapshot
Click the Add buttons for Settings snapshots under CONSVC_SHEPHERD:

1. Input a name 
   * recommendation is to have the name relate to the changes done to the advertiser (ex. Added Advertiser X Y and Z or Added Black Friday URLs to X) The name has a 128 Character limit.
2. Select settings type. At this time, this would be the Partner name.
3. Hit Save. A Snapshot has been saved. 
4. To publish it, click the checkbox that corresponds to the snapshot. 
5. Select “Publish Settings Snapshot” from the actions dropdown and click “Go”.
   * A green status bar should appear at the top of the page stating the snapshot has been published.

*Note that Shepherd is unable to undo snapshots. 
If changes need to be undone, one would have to manually revert the advertiser information and create a new snapshot.
For complex reverts, please contact the engineering team.*
