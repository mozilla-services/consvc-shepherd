# AdOps Dashboard Frontend

The AdOps Dashboard is a React + Typescript + Vite + SWC app set up with Vite's plugin: [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc)

# Running in development

You can run this app together with the Django app in one `docker-compose up --build` command from the root of this repo.
